# base

A clean slate to start a react project.

First install the dependencies with: `yarn or npm i`.
After that you can run ` yarn start or npm run start` to run the project.
This will boot up a webpack dev server which will serve the project on localhost:3001.

To build a production build just run `yarn build or npm run build`.
